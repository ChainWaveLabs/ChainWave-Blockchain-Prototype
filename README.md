Prototype/demo blockchain from scratch.

## Basic Blockchain Functionality

This simple prototype consists of basic Bitcoin-like functionality including:

- Initialization of genesis block
- Block creation
- Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm
- Proof validation
- Transaction processing

## Blockchain API

Flask is used as the API endpoint mapping to our Python functions
