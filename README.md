# ChainWave-Blockchain-Prototype

Prototype/demo blockchain from scratch. This is not novel or new and should be considered more a showcase of blockchain development competencies.

## Basic Blockchain Functionality

This simple prototype consists of basic Bitcoin-like functionality including:

- Initialization of genesis block
- Block creation
- Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm
- Proof validation
- Transaction processing

## Blockchain API

Flask is used as the API endpoint mapping to our Python functions


## Install & Run
- Prereqs: python 3.7, pipenv, and Postman
- ```pipenv install```
- ```python Blockchain.py``
- Import the "Blockchain Python..." postman collection json file
- Explore the postman collection for potential actions. Remember you must mine to see new tx's
